# Roboflow Custom Detectron2

This repository contains a custom implementation of [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) integrated with [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) to train a custom object detection model.

## Overview

This project utilizes **Detectron2**, Facebook AI Research's next-generation object detection platform, and integrates it with **Roboflow** to simplify the dataset creation and management for training custom models. With this setup, users can train models for custom object detection tasks, such as detecting specific objects, animals, or scenes.

## Features

- **Custom Object Detection:** Train a Detectron2 model on your custom dataset.
- **Roboflow Integration:** Seamlessly export datasets from Roboflow for use with Detectron2.
- **Preprocessing & Augmentation:** Apply advanced data augmentation techniques directly via Roboflow.
- **Model Training:** Train state-of-the-art object detection models using Detectron2's robust and flexible framework.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 1.7.0 or later
- Detectron2
- Roboflow
- Other dependencies: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `matplotlib`, etc.

To install the dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Roboflow_Custom_Detectron2.git
cd Roboflow_Custom_Detectron2
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Setup Roboflow API

- Sign up or log in to [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/).
- Create a project and upload your custom dataset.
- After uploading, obtain your API key from your [Roboflow account](https://roboflow.com/settings).

### 5. Download Your Dataset

Once you have your dataset uploaded to Roboflow, you can download it using the Roboflow API by running:

```bash
python download_dataset.py --api_key YOUR_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY --project YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
```

Replace `YOUR_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` and `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` with the appropriate values from your Roboflow account.

### 6. Configure the Dataset

Make sure the dataset is in the correct format for Detectron2. If the dataset is in COCO or Pascal VOC format, the repository contains a script to convert the dataset to Detectron2's format.

### 7. Train the Model

Now, you can train the custom object detection model. Run the following command to start training:

```bash
python train_model.py --config-file configs/custom_config.yaml --num-gpus 1
```

- `--config-file`: The configuration file containing hyperparameters for training.
- `--num-gpus`: Number of GPUs to use for training.

## Model Inference

Once the model is trained, you can run inference on images or videos. Here’s how to use your trained model for predictions:

```bash
python predict.py --model-path output/model_final.pth --input-path input_image.jpg
```

This will use the trained model to predict objects in the provided image (`input_image.jpg`).

## Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of your model on a test dataset, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path output/model_final.pth --test-data test_data.json
```

## Notes

- Make sure to adjust the configuration file (`configs/custom_config.yaml`) to match the specifics of your dataset and model.
- The dataset should be in the correct format (COCO or Pascal VOC) to ensure smooth integration with Detectron2.
